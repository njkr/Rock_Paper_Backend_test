# # Backend Developer Test for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Backend Developer Test for the Rock-Paper-Scissors Game. This test is designed to assess your skills in backend development, including API creation, database interaction, and payment gateway integration. You are expected to complete the tasks by **6/7/2024**.

## Task 1: API Development

### Objective

Develop a RESTful API for the Rock-Paper-Scissors game to handle game logic, user management, and game sessions.

### Requirements

- Set up a Node.js/Express.js or Django server.
- Implement endpoints for:
  - User registration and authentication.
  - Starting a new game session.
  - Recording the player's move and determining the outcome against the computer's move.
  - Fetching game history for a user.

## Task 2: Database Integration

### Objective

Integrate a database to store user information, game sessions, and game history.

### Requirements

- Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).
- Define appropriate models/schemas for users and game sessions.
- Ensure secure storage of user passwords (e.g., hashing with bcrypt).

## Task 3: Payment Gateway Integration

### Objective

Integrate a payment gateway to enable transactions using fiat currency (e.g., PayPal).

### Requirements

- Set up and configure a payment gateway (e.g., PayPal) to handle deposits and withdrawals.
- Implement backend endpoints to interact with the payment gateway:
  - Process payments for game bets.
  - Handle transaction confirmations and record them in the database.
  - Fetch transaction history for a user.

## Submission Guidelines
